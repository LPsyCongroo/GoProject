# Go

An implementation of the board game Go. A work in progress after I realized how badly I needed to master algorithms and data structures before tackling this seriously. You can see the state of the app before I left it [here](http://ali-r.com/GoProject/).

I should probably take this up again. In fact, dare I say... I should give it another... go?
